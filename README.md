    The bond between humans and their pets is cherished globally, and AavePet recognizes the importance of providing optimal care for beloved companions. This white paper introduces AavePet, a decentralized platform that integrates blockchain technology, DeFi principles, and a Pet NFT Marketplace to revolutionize pet care and fundraising.

    AavePet Ecosystem
    2.1 AavePet Token (APT)
    AavePet Token (APT) is the native cryptocurrency within the AavePet ecosystem. It serves as a medium of exchange, allowing users to purchase pet-specific goods and services, such as veterinary visits, pet food, toys, and more. APT is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring security, transparency, and interoperability.

2.2 AavePet Smart Contracts
AavePet utilizes smart contracts on the Ethereum network to facilitate secure and transparent transactions. These smart contracts govern the distribution, management, and usage of APT tokens, ensuring trust and reliability within the ecosystem. Furthermore, they enable the integration of third-party applications and services, expanding the utility of APT.

By minting pet NFTs, owners can showcase their pets' uniqueness and sell them to raise funds for their pets' care. The Pet NFT Marketplace provides a new and exciting way for pet owners to engage with the community and support their pets' needs.
